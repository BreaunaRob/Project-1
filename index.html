      <p><em><strong>Student</strong> learning with Angela Yu's Web Development Coding Bootcamp 2022</em>.</p>
        <p>Hello, my name is Breauna Robinson and I am not only a first time coder, but also
          a first time mother. Coding has always been something that I was interested in, but was too
          afraid to begin due to the fact that I <strong>thought</strong> I was unable to dedicate my time and attention due to being a mother
          and a full time employee. But, after much research and personal testimonies from others, I found that to be a quite untrue.
          Now, I am a few days into Angela Yu's Coding Bootcamp and <em><strong>loving it thus far!</strong></em></p></td>
